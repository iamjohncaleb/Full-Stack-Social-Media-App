- **npm** or **yarn**
- **MongoDB** (local or hosted)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/full-stack-social-media-app.git
   cd full-stack-social-media-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies for the frontend:**

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

   or

   ```bash

3. **Install dependencies for the backend:**

   ```bash
   cd ../backend
   npm install
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

### Running the App

1. **Start the backend server:**

   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm run dev
   ```

   The backend will start running on `http://localhost:5000`.

2. **Start the frontend development server:**

   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

   The frontend will start running on `http://localhost:3000`.
